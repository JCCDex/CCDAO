            3.2 Transfer and receive Tokens. You may manage your digital Tokens by using the transfer and reception
            functions of CCDAO, i.e., you may revise the blockchain ledger by signing with your Private Key. Tokens

            Tokens happens on the blockchain system (instead of on CCDAO).

          </div>
          <div>
            3.7 Suspension of service. You understand that we are not able to reverse or cancel the transaction because
            transactions based on blockchain technologies are irrevocable. However, under certain circumstances, we may
            suspend or limit the function of CCDAO used by a particular User.
          </div>
          <div>

            agreed to and recognized all terms.During the registration using the CCDAO mobile phone number and email
            address (the effective decentralized solution under the EOS system), your mobile phone or email address will
            be collected as a voucher. The multiple-signature authority of Owner will be added by default to facilitate
            the retrieval of the private key.In the registration method using the mobile phone and email address (the
            effective decentralized solution under the EOS system), we will impose the multiple-signature setting to
            CCDAO Owner authority to safeguard users’ authority security to the greatest extent. Additionally, the block
            information is traceable, which enables the largest openness and transparency. The initiator of every
            operation on the account can be checked.
          </div>
          <div>
            3.9 Token exchange. Users can exchange tokens with third-party smart contracts or third-party DEXs. As an

            6.1 You understand and acknowledge that the blockchain technology is a field of innovation where the laws
            and regulations are not fully established. You may be faced with material risks including instability of
            technology or failure of Tokens redemption. You also understand that Tokens have much higher volatility
            comparing to other financial assets. You shall make investment decisions and hold or dispose of the Tokens
            in a reasonable way and corresponding to your financial status and risk preferences. You also acknowledge
            that the market information is captured from exchanges by CCDAO and may not represent the latest or the best
            quotation of each Token.
          </div>
          <div>
            6.2 If you or your counterparty fails to comply with this Agreement or fails to follow the instructions,
            tips or rules on the website or on the page of the transaction or payment, CCDAO does not guarantee
            successful transfer of the Tokens and CCDAO shall not be held liable for any of the consequences of such
            failure. If you or your counterparty has already received the payment in CCDAO wallet or third-party wallet,
            you understand that transactions on blockchain are irreversible and irrevocable. You and your counterparty
            shall assume the liabilities and consequences of your transactions.
          </div>
          <div>
            6.3 You understand that blockchain operations and related transactions are irreversible. CCDAO shall not be

          </div>
          <div>
            6.4 When you use third-party-developed DApps integrated in CCDAO, CCDAO strongly suggest you read this
            Agreement and CCDAO’s Alert carefully, get familiar with the counterparty and the product information and
            evaluate the risks before you make transactions on such DApps.
          </div>
          <div>
            6.5 You understand that such transactions and corresponding contractual relationship are between you and
            your counterparty. CCDAO shall not be held liable for any risks, responsibilities, losses or expenses
            occurred due to such transactions.
          </div>
          <div>
            6.6 It is your sole responsibility to make sure that your counterparty is a person with full capacity for
            civil acts and decide whether you shall transact with him/her.
          </div>
          <div>
            6.7 You shall check the official blockchain system or other blockchain tools when you receive Alert such as
            “transaction failed” or “mining overtime” in order to avoid repetitive transfer. If you fail to follow this
            instruction, you shall bear the losses and expenses occurred due to such repetitive transfer.

            6.8 You understand that after you create or import wallet on CCDAO, your Keystore, Private Key and Mnemonic
            Words are only stored on your mobile device and will not be stored in CCDAO or on the servers of CCDAO. You
            may change another mobile device to use CCDAO after you follow the instructions on CCDAO to backup your
            wallet. If you lose your mobile device before you could write down or backup your Wallet Password, Private
            Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore, you may lose your Tokens and CCDAO is unable to restore them. If your
            Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore is disclosed or the device which stores or holds
            your Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words or Keystore is hacked or attacked, you may lose your
            Tokens and CCDAO is unable to restore them. You shall bear the foregoing losses on your own.
          </div>
          <div>
            6.9 We suggest you backup your Wallet Password, Private Key, Mnemonic Words and Keystore when you create or
